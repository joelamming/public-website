                    <h3>Two days in Florida</h3>
                    <p>This brief excursion away from the cold, damp darkness of London presented what I believe is the
                        most compelling demonstration of <strong>actually useful</strong> generative AI for enterprise
                        and industry that I've seen yet in 2024.</p>
                    <p>I was invited to the conference by an enterprise software firm, beginning with a morning speech
                        from their CEO, setting the tone for 43 intense hours of product demos, actual lectures, panel
                        discussions, customer interviews and in-depth dev team conversations. Contrary to my initial
                        impressions that the vast, opulent venue and hard-hitting speaker list might be papering over
                        the nascent state of LLM-driven and LLM-augmented enterprise software, the event instead
                        effectively demonstrated that GenAI is evolving beyond the X-Twitter/Reddit/hustlebro hype and
                        beginning to deliver productivity to things that actually matter.</p>
                    <h3>Enterprise search is where it's at</h3>
                    <p>This particular company's vision for the future is enterprise search. Yep – the familiar search
                        box, introduced by AltaVista in 1995, popularised by Yahoo and now known as “Googling”.</p>
                    <p>But this unnamed software firm isn't trying to compete with Google or Bing or even Perplexity.
                        Even Google is beginning to drown in SEO mush flooding the open web. What this firm offers
                        instead is an internal search engine to replace the clunky, keyword-dependent and domain-naïve
                        systems built into Windows Explorer, Finder, Outlook and SharePoint.</p>
                    <h3>Surely we can just build this ourselves with open-source tools?</h3>
                    <p>The AI community will say, “but don’t semantic search engines already exist? FAISS has been
                        around forever. Typesense just added vector search. Open-source embedding models are effective,
                        available and lightweight enough to run fast on my Dell laptop. Hugging Face has everything. I
                        have this great Streamlit frontend so my whole team can make use of this Python backend! Even
                        NVIDIA released a great consumer tool to chat with local docs!”</p>
                    <p>Those in industry will know the challenges of scaling enterprise and industrial data search – and
                        DataOps – beyond individual users or small, digital native teams is far harder than pooling,
                        extracting, chunking and indexing. Real-world IT and OT systems won’t have an API with great web
                        documentation. Some might have been installed by a system integrator in 2003 that has since
                        changed names twice. Some are proprietary. Some might even need a $1200 cable and adapter to
                        physically connect to them to your network. </p>
                    <p>But this software firm and others like it has spent years building and refining many such data
                        connectors and offer them, in most cases, as turnkey solutions.</p>
                    <h3>Index it all</h3>
                    <p>Connecting to everything digital within an organisation and making it accessible – not just to a
                        semantic search engine, but to a domain-specific, context-aware search engine – delivers
                        something Google and Microsoft and Facebook/Meta have had their incentives prevent.</p>
                    <p>This new breed of enterprise search knows who you are. It knows what you do. It knows what data
                        you have access to. It knows who your colleagues are, and it can therefore understand “show me
                        all of the backup generators running more than three degrees above spec today”. It visualises
                        complex, contextualised answers from proprietary data. It isn’t Google. It doesn't sell you
                        donuts. This isn’t personal data. This is enterprise data, industrial data, modelled to maximise
                        discoverability based on relevance to you, your work and your query – delivered fast to a web
                        interface making full use of familiar BI visualisations, tables, images and even 3D models with
                        drill-down functionality.</p>
                    <p>Search aligned with business operations. SearchOps? It just doesn’t sound right. Industrial and
                        enterprise DataOps might be here to stay. Power users don’t need to be coders. Power users just
                        need to describe what they’re looking for, and the machine does the rest.</p>
                    <h3>Out with chatbots, in with backend data curation and decorating</h3>
                    <p>Despite my initial scepticism, particularly this firm's history in relational databases, the
                        conversations I had with oil and gas people, manufacturing, military, utilities, cyber, tech
                        people – all contrasted against the “yeah, but chatbots are totally useless in my industry”
                        sentiment I heard throughout 2023. In March 2024, the guidance infrastructure around LLMs are
                        solidifying. Source attribution seems to be a solved problem. LLM hallucinations in the final
                        answer are increasingly rare. Most of all – buyers seem to be convinced.</p>
                    <p>A highlight of my experience was – aside from the Apple Vision Pro demo – spending an hour or so
                        in conversation with the product/dev leaders for this firm's generative AI team. We went deep
                        into the product, why the last couple of months have seen a significant turning point in
                        performance, the use of customer-specific LLMs on secure customer infrastructure, source
                        attribution techniques, agent-based retrieval, fine-tuning an open-source LLM to near-perfectly
                        convert natural language queries into the firm's data model and how time series, relational
                        databases, document-oriented databases and even knowledge graphs are used together to perform
                        lightning-fast search at a vast scale.</p>
                    <p>Plenty of others in this space are approaching industrial and enterprises data management in a
                        search-focused way. Some use knowledge graphs as the foundation, with time series and relational
                        and document databases where necessary. Others avoid time series. Some established players are
                        adapting their systems in much the way this particular vendor is. I will of course be watching
                        the industry closely.</p>
                    <p>2024 is going to be the year of much, much better enterprise and industrial search. And probably
                        also knowledge graphs built with generative AI. Fingers crossed.</p>
