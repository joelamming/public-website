    <h3>Who has a blog site in 2025?</h3>
    <p>Most would say blog sites (from "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog">web log</a>") had their
        heyday long ago. Early low-code platforms like Blogger and WordPress made blogging easy for anyone
        with an internet connection while social media platforms like MySpace, Facebook and LinkedIn
        popularised the idea of a personal online presence. Most of us are keenly aware of how fundamental
        the massive social media sites are to information distribution today, alongside the drawbacks –
        opaque algorithmic control prioritising engagement over all else – and the lack of content
        ownership.</p>
    <p>Individuals and organisations initially benefitted from social media as links to their sites spread
        far and wide. The late 2010s, however, saw social media platforms attempt to keep more traffic
        within their walled gardens, prioritising native content over external links. Referral traffic to
        external sites dropped. Google Search pushed from a different direction, achieving the same effect –
        trying to improve search results with an army of human quality checkers alongside a list of "<a
            href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/29/24167407/google-search-algorithm-documents-leak-confirmation">trusted</a>"
        domains.</p>
    <p>Those using web search engines today know how this just isn't working. High-quality content is harder
        to find than ever. SEO mush occupies the ten blue links. LinkedIn is mostly copy-pasted rage bait or
        "data architecture" diagrams from 5 years ago. Or worse – thin waffle generated by everyone's
        favourite autoregressive LLM. Some have moved to direct distribution via Substack. But I'm an
        engineer. I like to see how things work and whether there's a simpler solution that does the job
        even better. An approach that has been around forever, ready to be fitted with the best tech 2025
        has to offer.</p>
    <h3>We're back where we started back in 1997, when I was just a toddler in Shanghai.</h3>
    <p>This is yet another blog site. Focused on simplicity and discovery through organic links, distributed
        through whatever channels I want. Built from the ground up with the increasingly popular,
        back-to-basics (but still cutting-edge) and extremely lightweight <a href="https://htmx.org/">HTMX</a>
        library,
        served as a static site from GitHub Pages under my
        own domain. HTMX for a static site? It lets me automate the building of each page, right there in
        the browser, in a split second, despite having only a
        static webserver. <em>Everything</em> becomes modular. And if I need something that requires
        backend compute? That's where HTMX really shines. Add a
        new feature? Much easier to build it fast, spinning up backend compute to do the heavy lifting only
        where
        needed. No need for React here. Did someone remove <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Npm_left-pad_incident">left-pad</a> from npm? No
        dependencies here, not my problem. This chart needs 10MB of JavaScript to run? No thanks, I'll build
        it myself. No service to rely upon except the World Wide Web. Even if GitHub Pages disappears, the
        site just spins up somewhere else.</p>
    <h3>Who's Joe?</h3>
    <p>I'm a software researcher and consultant by day, focusing largely on enterprise and industrial
        DataOps and the practical applications of AI. Background is in mechanical engineering with
        sustainable energy systems at Southampton, famous mostly for its grey buildings and the <a
            href="https://seacitymuseum.co.uk/exhibitions/southamptons-titanic-story/">Titanic</a>, but also people
        who
        <a href="https://www.southampton.ac.uk/news/2015/12/web-southampton-history.page">invented</a> the
        internet.
        On paper, I'm British, although I'm not really from anywhere – growing up
        moving from China to South Korea to South Africa to the Isle of Man and eventually to London, UK.
        I've been building cool stuff since I was a wee lad, but the last decade and a half has really
        focused on software – and since circa 2017, AI. Most of the code I write is Python, although
        anything requiring a frontend uses HTML/CSS, HTMX and JavaScript. Performant custom backend stuff is
        written in Rust or C++.
    </p>
    <p>This blog is a place for me to write about whatever I want – and share the details of fun personal
        research and build projects, completely separate from my day job. While I work with incredible
        people and organisations, none of this will be discussed here. The only exceptions will be
        commentary on current events, stuff that's already public, especially on firms like
        Mistral, OpenAI/Microsoft, Google, Meta, Anthropic/Amazon or the interesting players in Asia like
        Alibaba,
        DeepSeek, ByteDance and Tencent. I have the freedom to present things my way – within the confines
        of what
        browsers in 2025 can do. Daunting.</p>
