            <h3>Who has a blog site in 2024?</h3>
                <p>Most would say blog sites (from the word "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog">weblog</a>") had their heyday long ago. Early low-code platforms like Blogger and WordPress made blogging easy for anyone with an internet connection while social media platforms like MySpace, Facebook and LinkedIn popularised the idea of a personal online presence. Most of us are keenly aware of how fundamental the massive social media sites are to information distribution today, alongside the drawbacks – opaque algorithmic control prioritising engagement over all else – and the lack of content ownership.</p>
                <p>Individuals and organisations initially benefitted from social media as links to their sites spread far and wide. The late 2010s, however, saw social media platforms attempt to keep more traffic within their walled gardens, prioritising native content over external links. Referral traffic to external sites dropped. Google Search pushed from a different direction, achieving the same effect – trying to improve search results with an army of human quality checkers alongside a list of "<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/29/24167407/google-search-algorithm-documents-leak-confirmation">trusted</a>" domains.</p>
                <p>Those using web search engines today know how this just isn't working. High-quality content is harder to find than ever. SEO mush occupies the ten blue links. LinkedIn is mostly copy-pasted rage bait or "data architecture" diagrams from 5 years ago. Or worse – thin waffle generated by everyone's favourite autoregressive LLM. Some have moved to direct distribution via Substack. But I'm an engineer. I like to see how things work and whether there's a simpler solution that does the job even better. An approach that has been around forever, ready to be fitted with the best tech 2024 has to offer.</p>
                <h3>We're back where we started back in 1997, when I was just a toddler in Shanghai.</h3>
                <p>This is yet another blog site. Focused on simplicity and discovery through organic links, distributed through whatever channels I want. Built from the ground up with the increasingly popular, back-to-basics (but still cutting-edge) and extremely lightweight <a href="https://htmx.org/">HTMX</a> library, served as a static site by GitHub Pages and under my own domain. Add a new feature? Just build it. Did someone remove <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Npm_left-pad_incident">left-pad</a> from npm? No dependencies here, not my problem. This chart needs 10MB of JavaScript to run? No thanks, I'll build it myself. No service to rely upon except the World Wide Web. Even if GitHub Pages disappears, the site just spins up somewhere else.</p>
                <h3>Who's Joe?</h3>
                <p>I'm a software researcher and consultant by day, focusing largely on enterprise and industrial DataOps and the practical applications of AI. Background is in mechanical engineering with sustainable energy systems at Southampton, world famous for its grey buildings and people who invented the internet. On paper, I'm British, although I'm not really from anywhere – growing up moving from China to South Korea to South Africa to the Isle of Man and eventually to London, UK. I've been building cool stuff since I was a wee lad, but the last decade and a half has really focused on software – and since circa 2017, AI. Most of the code I write is Python, although anything requiring a frontend uses HTML/CSS, HTMX and JavaScript. Performant custom backend stuff is written in Rust or C++.</p>
                <p>This blog is a place for me to write about whatever I want – and share the details of fun personal research and build projects, completely separate from my day job. While I work with incredible people and organisations, none of this will be discussed here. The only exceptions will be commentary on current events, stuff that's already public, especially on firms like OpenAI/Microsoft, Google, Anthropic/Amazon or the interesting players in Asia like Alibaba and Tencent. I have the freedom to present things my way – within the confines of what browsers in 2024 can do. Daunting.</p>
